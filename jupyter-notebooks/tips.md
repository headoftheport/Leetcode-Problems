##### Arrays

1. when solving for the array problem check if the problem can be solved with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity
2. O(1) space complexity means, usage of constant space. as long as space needed to run the solution does not change with the change in the input size then solution could be O(1) space
3. when thinking of solution think of using multiple pointers ( ideally two ) can improve the efficiency of the solution, both the pointers could be travelling in the same direction of opposite direction 
4. while thinking of the solution check if travelling the array in reverse will improve the efficiency of the soultion
